# UX Portfolio

I am in my last semester of Chico state! I have also already taken Software Engineering last year and really enjoyed the class. I am very excited to be taking a class that In kjinbw will be helpful for my design in my career moving forward, that doesn't have a ton of technical work included as well. Should be a fun time!
